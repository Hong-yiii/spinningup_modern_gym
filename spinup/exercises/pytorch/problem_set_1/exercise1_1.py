Exercise 1.1: Diagonal Gaussian Likelihood

Write a function that takes in PyTorch Tensors for the means and 
log stds of a batch of diagonal Gaussian distributions, along with a 
PyTorch Tensor for (previously-generated) samples from those 
distributions, and returns a Tensor containing the log 
likelihoods of those samples.
